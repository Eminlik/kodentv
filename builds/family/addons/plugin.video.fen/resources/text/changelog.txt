- 'Folder Linking' added for Fen Folder Scrapers (already available for Debrid Cloud scrapers). You can now 'link' a movie or TV Show to your local copy of it if Fen's Folders Scraper does not scrape it successfully i.e. wrong naming of folder, incorrect info from metadata etc. See Fen Tips for more info.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.15[/B][/COLOR]

1) Bringing up the Context Menu on an item in Movies/TV Shows, then.. Edit Menu->Check If Menu Has New Menu Items. Add the new menu item at your chosen position.
2) If 1) doesn't work, then.. Edit Menu->Restore Menu to default. This will add the new menu item automatically, but will remove any changes you made to your menu previously.

- Added option: Settings->Next Episodes->Appearance->'Cache To Disc'. Defaults to OFF. If set to ON, Kodi will display it's cached version of the Next Episodes list after playback ends, meaning you must back out of and back into the list to update it.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.08[/B][/COLOR]
[I]OK. Let's try this again..... [B]special thanks to Tinuz97 for lots of help testing.[/B]
- Debrid resolving (RD/PM/AD) now handled by Fen. Only Real-Debrid, Premiumize.me and AllDebrid are supported.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.6.07[/B][/COLOR]

- NOTE: Currently there is no support for downloading an uncached torrent to your cloud for later playback. This will come soon. At the moment, Fen will skip uncached torrents.
- ResolveURL is still a dependency so free links can be handled, and to get around Openscrapers needing a valid ResolveURL debrid account to use the debrid/torrent scrapers.

There is no context menu for the results when this setting is chosen i.e. no "Download File" option will be available, and the label will be single line only.
- Added fetching of fresh watched statuses when marking movie/episode watched during playback. Fen will now fetch this information whilst the movie/episode finishes playing, meaning possibly much quicker refresh times for lists like Next Episode after playback ends.
- Changes to layout of settings.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.101[/B][/COLOR]
- Changed input method for min/max torrent sizes so decimals can be used. e.g. Minimum Episodes: "0.753" will make minimum episodes size approx. 753MB.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.97[/B][/COLOR]

- Added 'Use Minimal Notifications' to Settings->Playback->Playback->Autoplay First Relevant Result. Defaults to On. This suppresses notifications during autoplay search and uses background dialog for scraper progress.
- Added 'Ignore Articles When Sorting Lists' to Settings->General->Navigation. Defaults to On. This makes Fen ignore 'the', 'an', 'a' etc when sorting user lists.

You can tell FEN how many scrape results a scraper must have stored before it is considered for disabling. Defualt is 25 scrapes. You can also see the current status of enabled external scrapers and choose to manually disable scrapers of your choice by navigating to Tools->External Scrapers->Disable Failing External Scrapers. Defaults to OFF.
- Also, you can clear the External Scrapers Success/Fail Stats by selecting Tools->External Scrapers->Reset Failing External Scraper Stats.

- Fixed double instance of 'HEVC' in scrape results info.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.93[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Link TV Show' to Cloud folders. If you utilize the RD, PM, or AD Cloud scrapers in FEN, then you can now assign specific TV Shows to your cloud folders. This is very handy if you have misnamed folders in your debrid clouds, which stops them from being detected by FEN's cloud scrapers. You can now navigate into your cloud files (Premium Services->[YOUR DEBRID ACCOUNT]->Cloud Storage), bring up the context menu on a FOLDER item, and link it to a specific show. FEN will then honor that link when scraping. [B]See FEN Tips for more info[/B].
- Added "Options Menu Style" to Settings->General->Navigation. Choose 'Dialog' or 'Context Menu'. Context Menu is new and will, you guessed it, display the Options menu in the style of a context menu.

- Added setting "Internal Scrapers Order" in Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering. Set the order Fen's internal scrapers will be displayed. Note: 'FILES' in the filter means all physical files found i.e. from 'local', 'downloads' and all 5 'folder' scrapers.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.90[/B][/COLOR]
- Added option in Settings->General->Appearance->Choose Settings Layout to change layout of the settings file. You can choose 'Basic', which removes the multiple submenu system FEN currently uses, or 'Advanced', which keeps the multiple submenus. The default will be 'Basic'. Read more through Fen Tips in the Tools menu.
- Changes to Folder Scrapers settings. Some settings now homogenized between Folder Scrapers.
- More changes to try and fix Subscriptions code.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.89[/B][/COLOR]
- Replaced 'Related' searches for Movies/TV Shows with 'Recommended'. Recommended gives better results, and also gives better results than 'Similar'.

- Changes to Subscriptions code.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.88[/B][/COLOR]
- FINALLY!! Fixed failed to play dialog popping up at end of playing a fen library item.

- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.87[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Shortcuts' Folders. When in Root, Movies or TV Shows menus, bring up context menu and select 'Edit'. Select 'Add Shortcut Folder' to add a folder to your current menu that you can now fill with other menu items from Fen (including Trakt lists). See Tools->Fen Tips->Shortcut Folders for more info.
- You can now choose whether or not to paginate all Personal Trakt lists (e.g. Collections, Liked Lists) or other personal lists (e.g. Subscriptions, Kodi Library). Settings for Trakt lists found in Settings->Trakt->Trakt Navigation. Settings for other personal lists found in Settings->General->Navigation. This is possible due to TMDb removing the rate limit on their API. Even so, if lists are large then they will load A LOT slower than if they were paginated.
- Include Openscrapers Module in settings cleanup.
- Temporarily implement some logging for subtitle downloads to try and catch a problem reported. It shouldn't spam the log.
- Changed Trakt API timeout threshold to 25 seconds.
- Assign 'icon' to kodi listitems for movies and tv shows.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.86[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.85[/B][/COLOR]

- Search options simplified and remade People search with new options.
- Other changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.83[/B][/COLOR]
- Added All Debrid Torrent Cache check. Be sure to authorize All Debrid in both Fen and ResolveURL to utilize torrent cache checking. Please test and report any bugs..
- Added All Debrid Cloud Scraper. Please test and report any bugs..
- Added All Debrid to 'Premium Services' menu. You can check your account info and browse/playback from your All Debrid Cloud. Please test and report any bugs..

- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.82[/B][/COLOR]

- UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MEANS YOU WILL HAVE TO SET UP ANY FOLDER SCRAPERS AGAIN. APOLOGIES, BUT THE NAMING OF THE 'SOURCE' SCRAPERS WAS REALLY BUGGING ME.

- Re-ordered settings slightly. There is a new "Trakt" settings tab that includes "Trakt Navigation", "Trakt Widgets" and "Trakt Cache" (Trakt Navigation and Trakt Cache have been moved from the "General" tab. Trakt Widgets includes a new setting).

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.74[/B][/COLOR]
EXPERIMENTAL..... Please report any issues in Github.
- Added 'Source1', 'Source2' and 'Source3' to Scrapers. Choose a Movie and TV Show directory for any of these scrapers, and Fen will scan those directories for results (including .strm files from other add-ons) [B]PLEASE SEE FEN TIPS IN TOOLS FOR INFO ON THESE SCRAPERS.[/B]
- Since there are now 5 Internal Scrapers that can be set to search for content before initiating a full scraper search, I remade the pre-scrape function to return all results in a dialog, where you can then choose a result to play before starting a full scrape of all scrapers. Internal scrapers that can be checked for results before a full scrape are Local, Downloads, Source1, Source2 and Source3. If autoplay is selected, any result from these 5 scrapers will initiate immediate playback before doing a full search will all scrapers.
- Fixed issues with displaying uncached/unchecked torrents.

- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.72[/B][/COLOR]
- 'Clean Settings File' added to Tools. Use this periodically to clear any obselete settings from Fen's settings.xml file. (As a natural part of development of Fen, sometimes a setting will be removed as it's no longer needed. These now obselete settings stay in your userdata settings.xml file. The smaller the settings.xml file, the quicker Fen can run).
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.71[/B][/COLOR]
- Code changes to Subscriptions.

- Added 'Show Biography' to context menu for 'Popular People' lists.
- Some other fixes/tweaks.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.66[/B][/COLOR]
[B][I]CLEAR METADATA CACHE IF HAVING ISSUES WITH THIS UPDATE.[/I][/B]
- Added Language selection to tikimeta. Access through Fen by: Settings-->External(Meta). The language selection is only for metadata, menus/dialogs within the add-on will still be English. Hopefully this can change eventually but it is a BIG job. Metadata will be automatically cleared when changing languages. First time navigation into seasons WILL take slightly longer when language is not English, as extra calls need to be made to the TVDb API.
- Added option to color highlight results based on Scraper or Quality(new).
- Complete refactoring of settings.xml. Settings are now grouped together and accessed by changing the top setting for each tab (most say "CHOOSE SETTINGS..."). Select the group of settings you want to change, and the relevant settings will become visible. I understand this will take a little while to get used to, but the settings from each tab were getting too long, and I hate scrolling down through settings and having relevant settings not visible.
- Added 'Biography' option for People Search. You can now search for Movies/TV Shows, Images or Biography of Actor/Actress.
- Added quick Kodi Log viewer to Tools.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.65[/B][/COLOR]

- [B]Attempting to fix results label bug some users are having (1).[/B]

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.60[/B][/COLOR]
- Many code changes in preparation for Kodi 19 Python 3 implementation. (Fen can now be used in a LIMITED way with Kodi 19 Python3. Internal Scrapers work as intended, but External Scrapers are currently broken due to a dependence on ResolveURL, which is not Python3 compatible.) Some functionality is broken with Kodi 19 Python3.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.57[/B][/COLOR]
- Added 'Discover Similar' to FEN Discover Movies and TV Shows. Enter the name of a Movie/Show, then enter a year (or leave blank if you don't know), then choose the movie to find similar titles from the list. Browse or Export the list as with other Discover filters. More info in Discover Help.
- Added 'Export Similar List' or 'Export Related List' to context menu when you are browsing results from a similar/related search from within regular Movie/Show menus. You can then export this as a menu item.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.54[/B][/COLOR]

- Improved subtitle downloading code.
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.53[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Animated Posters for Movies. Turn on in Tikimeta settings (KyraDB tab). Off by default. Only enable this if you have a powerful system running Kodi, and have a decent amount of RAM and hard drive space, as Kodi is sluggish when using animated posters, and the posters (GIFS) must be downloaded to the local machine. This means hundreds of megabytes of GIFS. It also means slow initial page loads for movies, as FEN must wait until needed GIFS are downloaded before loading the page. USE AT OWN RISK ON LOW POWERED DEVICES!!
- Clear Meta Cache to start using Animated Posters, or if having trouble after update...
- Other code changes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.52[/B][/COLOR]
- Remade sorting and filtering for results. Some settings moved to accommodate this. External results should now honor sort settings.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.50[/B][/COLOR]
- Re-wrote Fen Subscriptions (Library Integration). Unfortunately, you will have to remake your subscriptions and delete the contents of your Subscription folders.
- You can now choose a Trakt List (Watchlist, Collection, Personal Lists or Liked Lists) in Settings->Subscriptions for both Movies and TV Shows, and Fen will keep your Kodi library synced with these Trakt lists with each Fen Subscription Update. To utilize a refreshed and accurate Kodi library after updates, please enable both the "Update Kodi Library after Subscription Update" and "Clean Kodi Library If Items Removed". This will clear your removed Trakt list items and add the new Trakt list items to the Kodi library.

- Added Trakt Watchlist cache clear after marking any item watched if using Trakt for indicators.
- Changed setting for HEVC in Autoplay to 'Include, Exclude, Prefer'. Defaults to Include. If your device does not support HEVC(x265), set to 'Exclude' so Autoplay doesn't select a HEVC file to play. If you set to 'Prefer', Autoplay will sort all HEVC files to the top (meaning it will pick a 720p HEVC file to play before a 1080p non-HEVC file if there aren't any 1080p HEVC files).
- Partial re-write of sources.py.
- Added active progress dialog for Torrent Cache Check.

- Added second line color choice when using multiline for results. Choose 'No Color' to use the same color as line 1.
- Added 'Refresh Trakt Cache on Each Kodi Startup' to Settings->General->Trakt navigation and Cache. This will clear Fen's Trakt Cache when it is first accessed after a Kodi restart. Fen will then begin to refill the cache with data as needed.
- Re-organized settings for Search. Now split over 3 tabs (Results Display, Internal Scrapers and External Scraper).

- Other code changes.

- Added 'Resume List Browsing from Last Viewed Page' feature. Found in Settings->General->Navigation.
- Read about 'Resume List Browsing' in Fen tips (Tools->Tips for Fen Use), but briefly if turned on, Fen will remember your last viewed page number for any Movie/TV Show list you enter, and will re-load that page when you go back to that list again.
- 'Resume List Browsing' data can be cleared per list or all together. Read Fen Tips for more info.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.44[/B][/COLOR]

Make your own lists by setting filters like 'Genre', 'Start Year', 'Rating', 'Country' etc. Browse the newly created list, and/or export it to a Fen Main Menu (Root, Movie, TV Show) if you like, and give it a name. Help found in 'Discover: Help' or go to Tools->Tips for Fen Use->Fen Discover to read up on this new feature.
- From the root menu's context menu, select Edit Menu->Check if 'Root' Menu has New Menu Items to add 'Discover' to your root menu.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.5.41[/B][/COLOR]
- Unfortunately had to remove browsing into Furk Packs from media results. It was indirectly related to vidoes replaying after being stopped. Furk items from a media search will now auto-resolve the correct episode/movie file.
- Added Context Menu item in results to browse Furk Packs as a compromise.
- Fixed videos replaying when stopped.
- Removed Set View options for Furk, Furk Packs and Easynews. Replaced with 'Premium Files' view setting to cover these as well as RD-Cloud and PM-Cloud files.
- Simplified Download Directories. Now just Movies, TV Shows or Premium. If you download something from a Furk, Easynews, RD-Cloud or PM-Cloud listing, the download will go in the 'Premium' folder. If you download something from a media search result, it will go in the appropriate 'Movie' or 'TV Show' folder with proper folder tree structure i.e. TV Show Name/Season/episode_file or Movie(Year)/movie_file.
- Began work on searching for torrent packs with Tikiscrapers. This is a lot of work and will take some time.
